                It isn’t just a focus on dogs either. There’s a focus on specific breeds of dogs, mostly perpetrated out of fear for the dog. Pitbulls account for 1 out of every 4 dogs that is abused, which is a rate that has doubled in the past decade. Some of this data might be because more families are choosing to own this breed, but having communities ban the breed helps to condition an attitude of fear, which can lead to an attitude of abuse.
